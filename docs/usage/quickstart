## Running the tests

Currently there are no official tests for the code but a minimum working example can be run with:


```
python digitalfilters.py -n 5
```

which will create 5 snapshots of a turbulent flow field and generate the PODFS model of it. You can view the resulting mean field using ParaView which is generated in:


```
PODFS/spatial_mean_field_velocity.vtk
```

The program writes out the following ASCII files:

* PODFS_mean.prf - The mean field with columns X,Y,Z,U,V,W
* PODFS_mode_????.prf - The POD modes wih columns X,Y,Z,u,v,w
* PODFS.dat - The PODFS control file which includes 1. The number of POD modes. 2. The PODFS period. 3. The number of Fourier Coefficients for each POD mode. 4. The Fourier Coefficients.
