it is called using: \\

 \noindent  \textit{python digitalfilters.py} [options] \\

\noindent Failure to select any options will activate the help menu which is also accessible using the \textit{-h} or \textit{-{}-help} options tags. \\

\noindent The program once activated will generate a set of 2D planar turbulent fields with the properties specified and then compute the PODFS approximation to those fields. The following options may be selected: \\

\begin{longtable}{p{.4\textwidth} p {.6\textwidth}}

\textit{-i} or\textit{-{}-inputfile=} & This specifies the desired ASCII input profile file. It is also possible to choose from default profiles  (see \textit{--mean\_profile}). The file should contain a series of columns titled `y', the wall normal direction, `U', the mean axial velocity, `uu', the axial component of Reynolds stress, `vv', the wall normal component of Reynolds stress, `ww', the spanwise component of Reynolds stress and `uv', the Reynolds shear stress along the wall. The range of y should be [0,1] where 0 is the wall and 1 is the centreline of the channel. If the input file is of the type `.prf' then a 2D profile will be generated from the input file. In this case the file should have the columns `x',`y',`z',`u',`v',`w' and either `te` (turbulent kinetic energy), and one of `ed' (dissipation rate) or `sdr' (omega), or the Reynolds stress profile `uu', `vv', `ww' (cross stresses are optional). If Reynolds stresses are excluded, they are generated using the Boussinesq eddy viscosity approximation. The length scale is assumed to be $0.07D_h$ where $D_h$ is the hydraulic diameter. But it may be overridden using the \textit{-l} command.\\

\textit{-p} or \textit{-{}-mean\_profile=} & This option allows the user to select from a range of standard profile shapes (see Figure \ref{fig:profiles}). If this option is combined with the \textit{-i} option then the loaded 1D profile will be altered to fit the \textit{mean\_profile} chosen. The options are: \\

\quad \textit{hyperbolic-tangent} & A hyperbolic tangent profile as used in a planar jet. \textit{Default} \\

\quad \textit{double-hyperbolic-tangent}& As above but thee profile is applied in both principle directions as would be the case for a square jet. \\

\quad \textit{circular-hyperbolic-tangent}& A hyperbolic tangent profile as used in a round jet. \\

\quad \textit{ring-hyperbolic-tangent} & A hyperbolic tangent profile as used in a ring such as the outermost inlets of a fuel spray nozzle. \\

\textit{-{}-turb\_profile=} & This option allows the user to select from a range of standard profile shapes, they are: \\

\quad \textit{top-hat}& u'u'=v'v'=w'w' over all the inlet. \textit{Default} \\

\quad \textit{none} & No turbulence.  \\

\textit{-{}-U0=} or \textit{-{}-bulk\_velocity=} & The bulk velocity magnitude in the plane normal direction. \textit{Default = 1.0}\\

\textit{-{}-udash= } & The u'/U0 value. u'=v'=w'. \textit{Default = 0.02}\\

\textit{-n} or \textit{-{}-num\_steps=} & The number of timesteps to calculate using the digital filter technique. This does not have to be equal to the number of steps in the final simulation but the number of steps multiplied by the time step will give the repeating period of the inlet. \textit{Default = 20}\\

\textit{-l} or \textit{-{}-lengthscale=} & The turbulent length scale in terms of the inlet plane grid spacing. \textit{Default = 3.0}\\

\textit{-f} or \textit{-{}-filter\_width=} & The half filter width in terms of the number of length scales. This should be greater than 2. \textit{Default = 2.0} \\

\textit{-k} or \textit{-{}-nk=} & The number of grid points in the k or wall-normal direction. Each cell is assumed to be square, therefore the shape of the inlet can be stretched by adjusting the number of cells in each direction. \textit{Default = 11}\\

\textit{-j} or \textit{-{}-nj=} & The number of grid points in the j or span-wise direction. Each cell is assumed to be square, therefore the shape of the inlet can be stretched by adjusting the number of cells in each direction. \textit{Default = 10}\\

\textit{-t} or \textit{-{}-dt=} & The timestep in seconds. If this is not specified the time step will be calculated based on the length scale and the mean velocity. If this is specified then the axial length scale will be adjusted based on the time step and mean velocity. The length scales in the j and k directions will not change. \\

\textit{-m} or \textit{-{}-num\_modes=} & The number of POD modes to use in the PODFS model. This should be less than the number of timesteps. A small number will produce a less accurate but faster model, a large number produces a more accurate but slower model. Use the \textit{POD.eigenvalues.dat} file to check how much of the fluctuating energy field is captured using the chosen number of modes. \textit{Default = 20}\\

\textit{-e} or \textit{-{}-et=} & The energy target for the Fourier reconstruction. 0.9=90\%. A small number will produce a less accurate but faster model, a large number produces a more accurate but slower model. If numbers very close to 1 are used there may be spurious high frequency oscillations in the temporal reconstruction. Use the \textit{-v} option to check the \textit{POD\_tmode\_recon*.png} files using a small number of \textit{-n}. \textit{Default = 0.9} \\

\textit{-v} or \textit{-{}-verbose} & Save the generated digital filter fields used to produce the PODFS model as .prf files which can be loaded directly into PRECISE-UNS using the \textit{trans} boundary option. Also save the POD temporal modes and the Fourier reconstructions of them. The spatial POD modes are also saved in .vtk format. \\

\textit{-r} or \textit{-{}-resolution=} & The resolution of the generated inlet plane. Enter this in the dimensions of meters per grid point. \textit{Default = 0.1 m}\\

\textit{-{}-nx=} & The inlet plane normal direction, x-component. You can use the \textit{POD\_spatial\_mean\_field\_velocity.vtk} file to check if the plane is in the correct location. \textit{Default = 1}\\

\textit{-{}-ny=} & The inlet plane normal direction, y-component. You can use the \textit{POD\_spatial\_mean\_field\_velocity.vtk} file to check if the plane is in the correct location. \textit{Default = 0}\\

\textit{-{}-nz=} & The inlet plane normal direction, z-component. You can use the \textit{POD\_spatial\_mean\_field\_velocity.vtk} file to check if the plane is in the correct location. \textit{Default = 0}\\

\textit{-{}-ox=} & The x-coordinate of the centre of the inlet plane. You can use the \textit{POD\_spatial\_mean\_field\_velocity.vtk} file to check if the plane is in the correct location. \textit{Default = 0}\\

\textit{-{}-oy=} & The y-coordinate of the centre of the inlet plane. You can use the \textit{POD\_spatial\_mean\_field\_velocity.vtk} file to check if the plane is in the correct location. \textit{Default = 0}\\

\textit{-{}-oz=} & The z-coordinate of the centre of the inlet plane. You can use the \textit{POD\_spatial\_mean\_field\_velocity.vtk} file to check if the plane is in the correct location. \textit{Default = 0}\\

\textit{-{}-rotate=} & You can use this to rotate the plane about its normal vector. Entered value should be in degrees. You can use the \textit{POD\_spatial\_mean\_field\_velocity.vtk} file to check if the plane is in the correct location. \textit{Default = 0}\\

\textit{-{}-ring=} & The inner diameter of the ring if using the \textit{ring-hyperbolic-tangent} option expressed as a proportion of the outer diameter. \textit{Default = 0.5}\\
