# PODFS Digital Filter Inlet Turbulence Generator

This repository contains the PODFS/digital-filter code used to generate turbulent fields at the inlet of scale resolved simulations of turbulent fluid flow. It uses the digital filter method (Klein 2003) to generate the fields and the PODFS method (Treleaven 2019) to compress the data into a useful format that can be efficiently loaded into a CFD solver.
